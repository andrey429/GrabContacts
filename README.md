GrabContacts
============

**GrabContacts** is a console utility to parse VCard files and restore contact information to a txt file (#-separated values, \\r\\n-separated rows)
I used this to restore stuff from my contacts backup from good old Nokia phone :)


Usage

$ java GrabContacts [input .vcf file] [output .txt file]
